This is a small project I decided to create because I realise that a lot of people, especially my friends and family, look through amazon a lot almost every day and different items to check if the prices have been updated. So i made an extremely simple python script which I will package into an executable so the user doesnt require an IDE

THIS IS NOT COMPLETE AS THERE ARE A FEW MORE QOL updates I need to do such as making it easier to use rather than having the user create an excel file first and also having specific names to the directory. 
Should be done in a few more days by 10th of september
